## BTG Computation

Extracts Business Transactions Graphs (BTGs) from an integrated instance graph (IIG) 
as described in [BIIIG: Enabling Business Intelligence with Integrated Instance Graphs](http://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/de/publication/title/biiig).

## Label Propagation

Finds communities inside networks by propagating vertex labels (communities). 
Vertices migrate to the community represented by the majority of labels sent by its neighbours.
Our implementation adds a stabilization mechanism and avoids oscillating states.
See [Wikipedia (Label propagation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_Propagation_Algorithm).

## Adaptive Repartitoning

Partitions a graph using label propagation as described in [Adaptive Partitioning of Large-Scale Dynamic Graphs](http://www.few.vu.nl/~cma330/papers/ICDCS14.pdf).
The implementation uses giraph aggregators to ensure a balanced partition load.
